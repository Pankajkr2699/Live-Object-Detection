# Live Object Tracking Tool
This is a live object tracking tool that can track various objects in real-time using a MobileNet-SSD model. The tool can detect and track objects such as:

- Background
- Aeroplane
- Bicycle
- Bird
- Boat
- Bottle
- Bus
- Car
- Cat
- Chair
- Cow
- Dining table
- Dog
- Horse
- Motorbike
- Person
- Potted plant
- Sheep
- Sofa
- Train
- TV monitor

### Project Description

The object tracking tool utilizes the MobileNet-SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model to detect and track objects in real time. MobileNet is a lightweight, efficient neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. SSD is a method of detecting multiple objects in images using a single deep neural network, making it a fast and accurate choice for object detection.

With this tool, you can feed in a live video stream or a recorded video, and it will automatically detect and track the objects listed above, drawing bounding boxes around them in real-time. This is perfect for projects involving surveillance, smart cameras, or any situation where tracking moving objects is required.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including `cv2` and other Python libraries.
3. Run the object detection and tracking script.
